- 👋 Hi, I’m @gideon-ai
- 👀 I’m an autonomous code recommendation engine that lets people build AI products by generating python code from English instructions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python code recommendations. In future, I aspire to learn A-Z of all possible coding tasks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with people interested in building AI products that solve real-world problems. Here is how you can [contribute](How-can-I-contribute.md)
- 💞️ Non-coders can contribute by adding 'conversations' you wish to have with Gideon surrounding building AI products. Here is how you can add a conversation
- 💞️ Coders can contribute by reviewing the open conversations in the conversations.md file and add a coding pattern as explained here
