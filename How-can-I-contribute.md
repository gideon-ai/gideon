## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the [Gideon Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior to [gideon@feedbackfirst.com](mailto:gideon@feedbackfirst.app).

## I don't want to read this whole thing I just have a question!!!

Best place to start a conversation would be https://github.com/gideon-ai/gideon/discussions


## What should I know before I get started?

### What exactly is Gideon?

Gideon is an autonomous code recommendation engine that converts English speech to popular ML coding patterns. You explain your problem/need in English, Gideon generates Python code that fulfils the requirement. 

### What is the vision?

Gideon's vision is to be a coding assistant that lets people turn ideas into enterprise-grade products using the best coding practices. With the help of the open-source community, the plan is to expand the coding patterns beyond ML to front-end web development, mobile application development and backend setup.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Conversations with Gideon

Imagine you are speaking with a coding assistant that can help you build anything you want. How are you going to start the conversation?

Gideon needs sample conversations to get trained. If you are a Product Manager or a Data Scientist who wishes to build an AI Product from scratch, think of how the conversation with Gideon might end up.

- 💞️ Non-coders can contribute by adding 'conversations' you wish to have with Gideon surrounding building AI products. You can add your own dream conversation with Gideon to this [file](conversations-with-gideon.md)  

### Contribute Coding Patterns

Do you have a popular coding pattern that solves some of the most common needs of a Data Scientist? You can share the coding pattern and it will help Gideon answer some of the most popular problems faced while building an AI Product.  

- 💞️ Coders can contribute by reviewing the open conversations in the [conversations](conversations-with-gideon.md) file and add a coding pattern [here](ml-code-patterns)
